The Animal Shelter plugin is proposed as a package of tools for animal protectors that facilitate the publication of cards, adoption, volunteering and donations.

== Description ==
Animal Shelter is a package of tools for WordPress to help publish animal files (dogs, cats...) and thus facilitate their adoption.

Currently the system supports the following animal cards:
-Dogs
-Cats

You can create the file of the animal with its photograph, data, as well as a series of fields that help filter and search.

When a user finds the animal they want to adopt, they can follow the defined process.
